// What the About box says, kept out of the dialog that shows it. Every fact is passed in

// platform — the same reason install-channel.ts takes an `InstallProbe`.
//
// The install channel is in there deliberately: it is the single fact that explains why a
// copy does or does not offer "Check for Updates" (see install-channel.ts), and the first
// thing worth knowing about a bug report from a build we did not install ourselves.
