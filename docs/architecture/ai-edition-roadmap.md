## 1. Goal & strategy

Make OpenScreen the host of the Axcut editing engine. The recorder stays the front door;
Axcut's **data model + UX patterns** are re-implemented on OpenScreen's own primitives —
**no Python sidecar, no Fastify server, no monorepo**. The Python/Fastify layers die; the
schema, agent runtime, and UI patterns live on in-tree.

Two layers, different rollout:

| Layer | What | Default? | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Editing model** | Multi-asset projects, clips + skip/zoom/speed/annotation ranges, transcript editing, virtual preview, document-driven exporter | **Default for everyone** | none |
| **AI features** | LLM providers (BYO key), agent chat, suggestions, session history, checkpoints | **Opt-in** | `AI_FEATURES_ENABLED` |

Local Whisper transcription is bundled and runs in-browser (`@xenova/transformers`) — **not**
gated, privacy-safe by construction.

## 2. Architecture (SSOT)

`AxcutDocument` (v3 Zod schema, `src/lib/ai-edition/schema/`) is the canonical project model:
`project · assets[] · transcripts[] · timeline{clips,gaps,skip/mute/speed/captionRanges} ·
annotations[] · zoomRanges[] · legacyEditor · agent · preview · export · history`. Renderer
holds it in a Zustand store (`store/projectStore.ts`); main process persists to
`userData/projects/<id>.axcut`. Legacy `.openscreen` v2 projects migrate to v3 on first open.

```
src/lib/ai-edition/       schema · document(migrate/timeline/transcribe/ids) · store · timeline · exporter
src/components/ai-edition/ NewEditorShell + Titlebar/Bottombar/LeftPanel/RightPanes/Preview/PreviewCanvas/
                          TimelinePane/VirtualPreview/TranscriptEditor/Modals/ExportDialog/ProviderSettings
electron/ai-edition/       document-service · chat-service · llm-call · llm-config-store · provider-registry
```

## 3. Locked decisions

1. **Stop behavior** — first recording auto-opens the editor; later ones stay in the recorder with a prompt.
2. **Auto-caption→annotation injection** — dropped; transcript editor is the SSOT for spoken words.
3. **React Query** — adopted for the agent layer.
4. **LLM credentials** — Electron `safeStorage` (OS keychain), not plain JSON.
5. **Whisper** — bundle a small model; picker (tiny/base/small/medium) in settings. Not an AI-feature gate.
6. **Proxy MP4** — dropped; rely on WebCodecs `StreamingVideoDecoder`. Known lag >30 min (§6 revival path).
7. **File extension** — keep `.openscreen`.
8. **Packaging** — single package, single repo, in-tree `ai-edition/` namespaces.
9. **`AI_FEATURES_ENABLED`** — gates only the LLM/agent surface; default off. Everything else ships to all.

## 4. Current status (2026-07-02)

Build health: **`tsc --noEmit` clean · 434 tests pass (55 files)** · lint clean.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| **Phase 0** schema + v2↔v3 migration + timeline math | ✅ done, tested |
| **Phase 1** multi-asset, clips/skips, Resources panel, new editor is the **only** editor (`App.tsx` → `AiEditionShell`, no kill-switch) | ✅ done |
| **Phase 2** VirtualPreview + `PreviewCanvas` (wallpaper, blur, drop-shadow, radius, padding, webcam PiP/dual/vertical/masks, cursor overlay, zoom, annotations) + transport/scrub | ✅ done |
| **Phase 3** document-driven exporter + Export dialog (MP4 720/1080/source, GIF) | ✅ done (round-trip test pending) |
| **Phase 4** transcription pipeline + TranscriptEditor + auto-captions (auto-transcribe first) | ✅ done |
| **Phase 6.1/6.2** chat-service + IPC + LeftPanel chat + ProviderSettings (8 providers) | ✅ done (P1 agent runtime, tool loop, checkpoints, undo added in `55372df`) |
| **Phase 7** provider registry + fetch-based LLM call (OpenAI-compat + Anthropic) | ✅ done (OAuth/PAT stubbed) |
| **Phase 8** multi-session chat history (create/list/select/rename/delete) | ✅ done in-memory (`9203c34`), tested |
| **Phase 9** i18n (`useScopedT` across components, 13 locales), undo/redo (Cmd+Z/⇧Z, works), region clipboard, EmptyState, keyboard shortcuts | partial — i18n sweep (P3.5) still open |

**Recently fixed on this branch:** design-token aliases (`--primary/--card/--card-foreground/--muted-foreground/--primary-foreground` were referenced but undefined → broke light theme; now mapped in `design-tokens.css`); Settings gear now opens `ShortcutsConfigDialog` (was a toast); dead `ChatPanel.tsx`/`ProjectPanel.tsx` removed; **TimelinePane rewritten to a multi-clip track model + media→timeline drag-drop fixed** (`90b4b3b` — the drop handler was on the whole workbench `<main>`, so drops only ever landed on the Preview); **`handleLoadedMetadata` clip-duration corruption fixed** (`3a4bc91` — it patched `clips[0]` unconditionally regardless of which asset's `<video>` fired the event, desyncing the progress bar from the timeline ruler/playhead whenever a second clip's asset loaded).

**Audit false alarms (verified NOT bugs):** undo/redo works (`useUndoRedoShortcuts` calls `undo()/redo()` internally; `pushHistory` wired in `setDocument`); `provider-registry.ts` exists.

---

## 5. Remaining work (prioritized)

### P0 — timeline viewport, pan, zoom, reorder (axcut port — granular plan, 2026-07-01)

**Reference sources (read in full this round):**
- **Axcut, local WSL clone** — `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\etienne\repos\axcut\apps\web\src\components\TimelinePane.tsx` (1537 lines). **Authoritative**; the GitHub mirror at `EtienneLescot/axcut` is stale (699 lines). Always read from the WSL path until both reconcile.
- **Axcut helper:** `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\etienne\repos\axcut\apps\web\src\lib\pointer-drag.ts` — `startGlobalPointerDrag`, the single primitive that backs resize / reorder / scrub / pan / navigator-drag.
- **OpenScreen `main`** — `git show main:src/components/video-editor/timeline/{TimelineWrapper,Item,Row,TimelineEditor}.tsx` for the dnd-timeline region model (already used here).
- **Design:** `design/openscreen-editor.html` — `.tracks-scroll` is `overflow-y: auto, overflow-x: hidden` (vertical-only). Lanes and tracks share the **same** coordinate system (clip blocks at `flex: 36.5`/`flex: 63.5`, pills at `left: 5%`/`left: 27%`/etc.). The two-handle slim zoombar at the bottom is purely cosmetic; there is **no navigator strip** in the design.

**Architectural decision (lock this in):**
The new editor's timeline follows **axcut's custom viewport model**, not the design's "fit-to-width only". A single `.timeline-canvas` holds the ruler + clip track + lanes + playhead, translated horizontally by `visibleStartSec * pxPerSec`. The viewport is `overflow: hidden`; native horizontal scroll is not used. This keeps lanes and clip track aligned at every zoom level (the previous attempt broke this by keeping them in separate containers — see `e965a5f` reverted in `2e4e4ee`).

**Granular task table:**

| # | Task | Axcut ref | Design ref | Status | Commit |
|---|------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| T01 | Port `startGlobalPointerDrag` helper | `lib/pointer-drag.ts` | — | ✅ done | `690c80e` |
| T02 | Port `ResizeState` / `PanState` / `NavigatorDragState` / `ClipReorderState` types + refs | `TimelinePane.tsx:54-87` | — | ✅ done | `8be3dda` |
| T03 | Compute `pxPerSec = fitPxPerSec * zoom` with `MAX_PX_PER_SEC = 280` | `:88, :163-169` | — | ✅ done | `8be3dda` |
| T04 | Replace `overflow-x: auto` with `transform: translateX(-visibleStartSec * pxPerSec)` on inner `.timeline-canvas`; viewport itself stays `overflow: hidden` | `:170, :907-908` | — | ✅ done | `8be3dda` |
| T05 | Adaptive ruler ticks (`chooseTickStep(90 / pxPerSec)` major + minor/4) | `:1529-1542`, `:917-925` | `.timeline-ruler` | ✅ done | `8be3dda` |
| T06 | Ctrl+wheel = `zoomAt(zoom * ±1.18, clientX)` — zooms **around the cursor** | `:752-756`, `:370-388` | — | ✅ done | `8be3dda` |
| T07 | Alt+drag AND middle-click-drag = `startPan` → updates `visibleStartSec` | `:693-726`, `:735-740` | — | ✅ done | `8c36398` |
| T08 | Clip body pointerdown = `startClipReorder` with `CLIP_REORDER_THRESHOLD_PX = 6` → live insert marker + `onMoveClip(clipId, insertIndex)` on release | `:618-689`, `:445-490` | — | ✅ done | `8c36398` |
| T09 | Clip join borders (`hasJoinedPrev/Next` within 1.5px) — extend left by 1px, width by 1px | `:962-991` | — | ✅ done (later reverted per user feedback) | `8c36398` |
| T10 | Move `.lanes` into the same `.timeline-canvas` as the clip track | — | `.annotation-track-row`, `.speed-track-row`, `.zoom-track-row` (lanes share container) | ✅ done | `ba328d5` |
| T11 | Build the navigator strip (`<div class="timeline-navigator">`) below the viewport: skip mini-marks + visible-window overlay (start/end/move handles) | `TimelinePane.tsx:1036-1066` | — (not in design) | ✅ done | `2cd6ad3` |
| T12 | Wire navigator window drag → `setVisibleWindow(start, end)` | `:821-842` | — | ✅ done (move-mode only — pxPerSec adjustment lands in C4/T12 follow-up if needed) | `2cd6ad3` |
| T13 | Remove the bottom zoombar slider (now redundant — the navigator IS the zoom UI). Keep the hint row only. | — | `.zoombar` is just two buttons | ✅ done (slider removed earlier in `f9d62e1`; replaced with navigator in `2cd6ad3`) | `f9d62e1` + `2cd6ad3` |
| T14 | Header row inside TimelinePane: "N clips · M skips · X:XX total" + clip N/M indicator + current time + "Place skip" button | `:849-895` | — | ✅ done | `8c80a5c` |
| T15 | "Place skip" toggle → `pendingCutPlacement` mode → next click adds a 1s skip via `onAddSkipRange`. Live `pendingCutPreviewSec` marker while armed. Esc cancels. | `:438-475, :495-518` | — | ✅ done | `8c80a5c` |
| T16 | Add `body.timeline-panning` / `body.timeline-scrubbing` / `body.timeline-placing-cut` / `body.timeline-reordering` cursor classes. Hover cursor = `pointer`, drag-state cursors per mode. | `:497-512, :654-656, :706-708, :723-725` | — | ✅ done | `6dc2358` |
| T17 | Compact skip mode: when `(endSec - startSec) * pxPerSec < 18`, render controls icon-only (no labels). | `:990-993`, `styles.css .timeline-skip-strip.compact` | — | ✅ done (no-op — skip controls are icon-only by default; documented here for tracking) | `6dc2358` |
| T18 | Skip hover-controls viewport-aware positioning (`controlsShiftPx` keeps controls onscreen near viewport edge) | `:1001-1010` | — | ✅ done | `6dc2358` |
| T19 | Wire `onPreviewSource` during pointer drag so the preview scrubs to the cut/skip edge being dragged | `:540-543` | — | ✅ done | `761496e` |
| T20 | Clip projection during reorder: `cursorSec` resequencing so non-dragged clips reflow when the dragged clip is held out of order | `:439-490` | — | ✅ done | `761496e` (already shipped, see `projectedClipLayoutById` in `TimelinePane.tsx`) |
| T21 | Wire `onDuplicateClip` parity — confirm Ctrl+C/V uses `selectedClipId` not `copiedClipId` fallback (axcut's flow) | `:480-505` | — | ✅ done | already shipped in spine (`2f53b2f`); `tl.duplicateClip(clipId)` exposed from `useTimeline` and called by the Ctrl+C/V handler in `NewEditorShell.tsx` |
| T22 | Design parity: `.tracks-scroll { overflow-y: auto, overflow-x: hidden }` — vertical scroll only (no horizontal scroll feature in the design). Axcut's translateX-pan replaces it. | — | `.tracks-scroll` | ✅ done | implicit — `bottombar` uses `overflow: hidden` + `display: grid` + `flex: 1` on the timeline body, achieving the same effect via flex instead of overflow |
| T23 | Design parity: clip blocks at `flex: 36.5` (proportional), not absolute pixels — multi-clip blocks share the row | — | `.track-block.block-1 { flex: 36.5 }` | ✅ done | implicit — clip blocks are sized by `width: durationSec * pxPerSec` (absolute px) but the SUM of widths equals the total timeline width, giving the same proportional behavior as `flex-grow` on a known total |
| T24 | Snap-guide line during region drag — visualizes the dnd-timeline collision-clamp | — | — | ✅ done | `07d868c` — `.snapGuide` renders 2px-wide red vertical lines in the timing ruler at both edges of the moving skip during resize |
| T25 | Floating drag tooltip showing time + range during resize/move (axcut has none; design shows `0:00.0 – 0:02.5` in pill labels; visual polish on top of T01–T23) | — | `.pill-value` already shows label | ✅ done | `07d868c` — `.dragTooltip` is a small floating pill just to the right of the moving edge showing `startSec → endSec` during resize |

**Already shipped (kept):**
- Multi-clip track + working media drag-drop → `90b4b3b`
- Skip (trim) resize + delete inside clip block → `7edfe49`
- Real Edit Clip dialog with embedded preview + draggable range → `96787e1`
- Ctrl+C/V clip duplicate → `2f53b2f`
- Region drag/resize for zoom/speed/annotation via dnd-timeline → `f70b7c4`
- Placeholder duration unification (60s) → `9837481`

**Sequencing for the spine PR (T01–T09):** T01 helper → T02 types → T03 pxPerSec → T04 viewport translateX → T05 adaptive ruler → T06 Ctrl+wheel-zoom-at-cursor → T07 Alt+drag-pan → T08 pointer-reorder → T09 join borders. Each commits cleanly on its own; T01–T04 are the load-bearing ones, T05–T09 are polish on top.

**Reverted:**
- `2e4e4ee` — reverts `e965a5f` (the broken `overflow-x:auto` + `BASE_PX_PER_SEC * zoomLevel` attempt). Lanes-back-in-canvas (T10) and navigator-strip (T11) will replace it properly.

### P1 — functional plumbing (the heart of "AI editor")

| # | Task | File / line anchor | Status | Commit |
|---|------|--------------------|--------|--------|
| P1.1 | Define a tool schema: `getCurrentDocument`, `getTranscript`, `addSkip`, `setSkipRange`, `setClipRange`, `replaceTimeline`. JSON-schema per tool, fed to the model as `tools[]`. Lives in `electron/ai-edition/agent-tools.ts` (new). | `chat-service.ts:65-78` (current SYSTEM_PROMPT) | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| P1.2 | Implement tool execution dispatch: when the LLM returns `tool_calls`, validate args against the schema, run the matching store action (via the IPC bridge in `useTimeline.ts`), and return a JSON result to the model. | `electron/ai-edition/chat-service.ts:130-200` (the `runChat` function) | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| P1.3 | Save a checkpoint to `chat-service.ts` (or new `agent-runtime.ts`) **before** running each tool — current `replace_timeline` style. The user can roll back. | `chat-service.ts` (no checkpoint layer) | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| P1.4 | Multi-turn tool loop: the model may chain tools (`addSkip` → `setSkipRange` → `replaceTimeline`). Max iterations cap (e.g. 8). Surface intermediate "I'm trimming silences…" toasts. | `chat-service.ts:150-200` | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| P1.5 | Replace the system prompt with a tool-aware one: list the tools, give the model a "current document JSON" snapshot it can `replaceTimeline` against. | `chat-service.ts:18-22` (current SYSTEM_PROMPT) | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| P1.6 | Bridge `agent-runtime` ↔ main process: spawn the runtime inside an Electron `utilityProcess` so long agent runs don't block the renderer. The IPC entry point `ai-edition.runAgent(chatId, message)` returns when done. | new `electron/ai-edition/agent-runtime-main.ts` + `src/native/contracts.ts` | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| P1.7 | In the chat panel, show a compact "applied: trimmed 0:02.1–0:02.4" line per tool call so the user sees what the model did. | `src/components/ai-edition/LeftPanel.tsx` (chat history block) | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| P1.8 | Undo button: a single click reverts the last tool batch by re-applying the pre-batch checkpoint. | `chat-service.ts` (no undo yet) | ✅ done | `55372df` |
| **P2.1** | **Chat persistence (Phase 8 remainder).** Move `sessionsByProject: Map<string, Map<string, ChatSession>>` (in `chat-service.ts:14`) into `better-sqlite3` under `~/.config/openscreen/chat.db`. Tables: `sessions(id, project_id, title, created_at, last_checkpoint_json)`, `messages(id, session_id, role, content, tool_calls_json, created_at)`, `checkpoints(id, session_id, label, document_json, created_at)`. | `electron/ai-edition/chat-service.ts:14` + new `electron/ai-edition/database.ts` | ❌ | — |
| **P2.2** | **OAuth device-flow + PAT auth (Phase 7 remainder).** Replace the `authKind === "oauth-device"` stub at `llm-call.ts:68-72` with a real device flow: `POST /device/code` → poll `/device/token` → store `access_token` in the OS keychain (`keytar`). Wire `ProviderSettings.tsx:372, 512` "Connect" button to launch the flow and surface the verification URL in a toast. PAT: read from env (`OPENAI_PAT`, `ANTHROPIC_PAT`) at startup. | `llm-call.ts:68-72` + `ProviderSettings.tsx:372, 512` | ❌ | — |
| **P2.3** | **Provider-registry expand.** Add `google` (gemini-1.5-pro via OAuth) and `github-copilot` (device flow) to `provider-registry.ts:PROVIDER_DEFINITIONS`. | `electron/ai-edition/provider-registry.ts` | ❌ | — |
| **P2.4** | **Streaming responses.** `runChat` returns a single buffered string today (`chat-service.ts`). Add SSE-style streaming so the chat panel can render tokens as they arrive. | `chat-service.ts` (no stream) | ❌ | — |
| **P2.5** | **Tool-call permission gate.** Before running a write tool (`setSkipRange`, `replaceTimeline`, etc.), check a "dangerous tools" flag — if disabled, return a friendly "I need you to confirm before I edit your project" message and pause. The user can toggle it in `ProviderSettings.tsx`. | new permission check in `chat-service.ts:runChat` | ❌ | — |

### P2 — feature completeness vs old editor / design

| # | Task | File / line anchor | Status | Commit |
|---|------|--------------------|--------|--------|
| **F2.1** | **Auto-zoom "wand" suggestions.** Add a `suggestZoomRegions` store action that scans `transcript.segments` for low-amplitude ranges (silence heuristic) and proposes `zoomRanges` covering them. Wire to the disabled "Magic" button in `Bottombar.tsx:160-162` (currently `disabled` with no `onClick`). | new helper in `src/lib/ai-edition/store/zoomSuggestions.ts` + `Bottombar.tsx:160-162` | ✅ done | `58feb34` |
| **F2.2** | **Region inspector — annotation options.** Add `fontFamily` (Inter / Mono / Serif) and `animation` (none / fade / pulse) fields to the `AnnotationRegion` schema; expose a `<select>` per field in `RightPanelStack.tsx`. | `RightPanelStack.tsx` annotation inspector panel + `lib/ai-edition/schema/index.ts` (`annotationSchema`) | ✅ done | `58feb34` |
| **F2.3** | **Region inspector — figure/blur advanced.** Color picker (already partial), mosaic size slider, blur radius slider, arrow direction toggle for shapes. | `RightPanelStack.tsx` figure/blur subpanel | ✅ done | `58feb34` |
| **F2.4** | **Advanced export options.** Expose `fps` (24/30/60) and `codec` (h264/h265/vp9) selects in `ExportDialog.tsx` next to the quality preset. Pipe to the existing exporter options object. | `ExportDialog.tsx` form + `src/lib/ai-edition/documentExporter.ts` (consumer) | ✅ done | `58feb34` |
| **F2.5** | **Round-trip export test.** A vitest (or Playwright) test that creates a 3-clip + 1-skip project in a temp dir, calls the exporter end-to-end, then runs `ffprobe` on the output to assert the duration is the expected sum of clip durations. Marked `test:e2e` so it only runs in CI. | new `src/lib/ai-edition/documentExporter.e2e.test.ts` | ❌ | — |
| **F2.6** | **Region drag snap-guide + floating tooltip.** axcut has both during region resize. Already shipped on the clip timeline (T24/T25). Port to `RegionTimeline.tsx`: a vertical guide at the snap point + a small tooltip showing the new `startSec` / `endSec` as the user drags a region handle. | `RegionTimeline.tsx` (region handle drag logic) | ✅ done | `01d6b46` |
| **F2.7** | **Multi-select region operations.** Shift-click to add a region to the selection, then Delete removes all selected. Currently single-region-only. | `RegionTimeline.tsx` selection state + `useTimeline.removeRegion` | ✅ done | `01d6b46` |
| **F2.8** | **Region clipboard (cut/copy/paste).** Cut removes + remembers, copy remembers, paste inserts at playhead. Currently only `regionClipboard.ts` exists with the storage layer but no UI wiring. | `regionClipboard.ts` (exists) + new shortcut handler in `NewEditorShell.tsx` | ✅ done | `01d6b46` |

### P3 — polish / fake-data displays

| # | Task | File / line anchor | Status | Commit |
|---|------|--------------------|--------|--------|
| **P3.1** | **Asset file size.** Add `sizeBytes: z.number().int().nonnegative().optional()` to `assetSchema` in `lib/ai-edition/schema/index.ts`. In `electron/ai-edition/document-service.ts` `addAsset()`, call `fs.stat(input.path).then(s => s.size)` (or sync) and store on the new asset. Renderer `LeftPanel.tsx:formatSize(undefined)` already exists; just thread the bytes through. | `lib/ai-edition/schema/index.ts:assetSchema` + `document-service.ts:addAsset` + `LeftPanel.tsx:formatSize` | ✅ done | `76d78db` |
| **P3.2** | **Camera-sidecar toast on failure.** In `NewEditorShell.tsx:145` (the `addAsset` flow), wrap the `findRecordingCamera` call in a try/catch and surface failure as `toast.error("No camera file found next to <recording>")`. | `NewEditorShell.tsx:145` + `projectStore.ts:154` | ✅ done | `76d78db` |
| **P3.3** | **RightPanes header Help buttons.** The `HelpCircle` button at `RightPanes.tsx:48-54` is rendered but `onClick` is a no-op. Wire to a popover that shows contextual help text per right pane (image, color, gradient, custom, effects, transcript). | `RightPanes.tsx:48-54` | ✅ done | `76d78db` |
| **P3.4** | **Pixel nits.** (a) `RightPanelStack.tsx:296` — annotation color default `#ffffff` → `var(--annotation)`. (b) `.transport .rec[aria-pressed]` hardcoded `#ffffff` → `var(--danger)`. (c) Modal backdrop `rgba(22,23,29,.55)` → `var(--overlay-dark)` (define the var if missing). | `RightPanelStack.tsx`, `NewEditorShell.module.css` (.transport .rec), `design-tokens.css` (modal backdrop) | (a) stale — `<input type="color">` needs hex, schema default already `#ffffff` by design. (b) stale — selector doesn't exist in current code. (c) ✅ done. | `76d78db` (c) |
| **P3.5** | **i18n sweep.** `ai-edition/*` still has hardcoded English: chat panel strings (`LeftPanel.tsx`), Header readouts in `TimelinePane.tsx` ("2 clips · 2 skips · 0:09.5 total"), modal titles in `Modals.tsx`, `ProviderSettings.tsx` labels, error toasts. Add a new `src/i18n/locales/en/ai-edition.json` namespace + 12 other locales + a smoke test in `src/i18n/__tests__/`. | `LeftPanel.tsx`, `TimelinePane.tsx`, `Modals.tsx`, `ProviderSettings.tsx` | ❌ | — |
| **P3.6** | **Region drag visual polish (F2.6 in P2).** Tracked under P2 row F2.6. |
| **P3.7** | **Timeline ruler hover scrub.** Hover the ruler with the mouse, click to seek to that time. Currently the ruler only handles pointerdown for the scrub gesture; a separate `pointermove → setCurrentTime` is missing for hover-feedback. | `TimelinePane.tsx` ruler `<div onPointerDown={handleRulerPointerDown}>` | ✅ done | `76d78db` |
| **P3.8** | **Track-lane empty state for "no clips".** When `clips.length === 0` and a drop happens, drop a single auto-generated clip from the dropped asset (already does this in `insertClipAt`). But if the asset is unknown format, the placeholder is unhelpful — add a clear "Drag a video from the left to start" hint. Already exists at `TimelinePane.tsx:907-911` ("Drag a video from the media panel here to start your timeline."). Verify the message survives the i18n sweep (P3.5). | `TimelinePane.tsx:907-911` | pending P3.5 — message is in place, awaiting i18n wrap | — |
| **P3.9** | **NPM-side CSS for the bottombar.** Confirm `Bottombar.module.css` exists or move the bottombar-specific CSS out of `NewEditorShell.module.css`. Currently scattered. | `NewEditorShell.module.css` vs new `Bottombar.module.css` | ❌ | — |
| **P3.10** | **Stable drag handle ordering.** `RegionTimeline.tsx` — the row handles (.left / .right) are currently absolute-positioned but their stacking doesn't match the design (right handle above the left). Add explicit `z-index: 1` on `.right` to keep it on top. | `RegionTimeline.tsx` | moot — dnd-timeline owns handles now, no `.left`/`.right` CSS in current code | — |

### Deferred / known limitations
- **Long-recording scrub lag (>30 min)** — proxy MP4 dropped by decision 6; revival = per-asset "Generate proxy" button.
- **SSE streaming for project changes** — unnecessary in single-user Electron.

---

## 6. Verification protocol
- **Per change:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean · `npm run test` green · new tests for new logic (vitest/jsdom).
- **Dev loop:** `npm run dev` → `http://localhost:5173/?windowType=editor` (browser shim persists to `localStorage["browser-shim-document"]`).
- **Per phase:** manual smoke on Win/mac for any exporter- or recorder-touching change (native helpers are frozen).
